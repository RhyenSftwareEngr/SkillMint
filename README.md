# SkillMint

**Live Demo:** [https://ns4pw-yyaaa-aaaam-aelaa-cai.icp0.io](https://ns4pw-yyaaa-aaaam-aelaa-cai.icp0.io)

**Empowering ICT Students through Decentralized Proof of Skills**

SkillMint is a Web3 platform that enables college-level ICT students—especially those in provincial areas of the Philippines—to build verifiable skill portfolios, discover tech events, and earn blockchain-backed credentials and token rewards.

---

## Project Overview

SkillMint is a decentralized platform designed to empower college-level ICT students—particularly those in provincial areas of the Philippines—by helping them build verifiable, blockchain-based portfolios. Through participation in hackathons, bootcamps, and tech seminars, students can earn NFT credentials and token rewards, showcasing their growth and skills in a trusted, transparent way. SkillMint also provides tools for event organizers to manage participation and issue verifiable badges, with plans to integrate into school systems for broader adoption. Powered by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), SkillMint ensures security, scalability, and accessibility for the next generation of tech talent.

---

## Problem It Solves

- Lack of credible proof for extracurricular learning
- Limited access to national-level events for students in provinces
- Scattered or fake digital credentials
- Low motivation for students to join events without clear benefits
- No trusted system for organizers to verify participation

---

## Solution Overview

SkillMint provides:
- **Student Portfolios** secured by blockchain (ICP)
- **Event Discovery** and application system
- **NFT Credentialing** and token rewards for verified participation
- **Organizer Tools** for event creation, verification, and token allocation
- **Future Integration** with school systems (e.g., LMS, registrar offices)

---

## Target Users

- **Primary**: ICT-related college students in the Philippines (especially outside Metro Manila)
- **Secondary**: Student orgs, tech companies, academic institutions hosting events

# `skillmint`

Welcome to your new `skillmint` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `skillmint`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd skillmint/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
